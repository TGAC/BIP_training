# BIP_training


This repository hosts workshop material related to the use of the [Brassica Information Portal](https://bip.earlham.ac.uk/).

Please contact <a href="mailto:bip@earlham.ac.uk">bip@earlham.ac.uk</a>, if you are interested in working on the workhop material outside an official workshop. 
That way, we can remove your uploaded mock-datasets afterwards.
